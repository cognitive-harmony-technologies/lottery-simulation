# Illinois Dispensary Tie Breaker Lottery Simulator

## Introduction
[Perception Farms, Inc](www.perceptionfarms.com) has developed this lottery simulator for the Illinois Dispensary Tie Breaker process.  This allows the user to determine their probability of winning a license given a few assumptions.  We provide this free of use to the applicant pool and legislators in order to showcase the unfairness of unlimited applications per entity.

## Prerequisites:
